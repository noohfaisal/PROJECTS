# Employee Future Prediction

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether an employee is likely to leave a company or not. The project is based on a dataset that contains information about employees, such as their age, job level, years of experience, etc.

## Dataset

The data for this project is contained in a  CSV file, employee_data.csv, which is included in this repository. This file contains information about the employees, such as their age, gender, marital status, education, job role, salary, and whether or not they have been benched in the past. The dataset consists of 4600 employee records with 8 features.

The dataset can also be downloaded from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/employee-future-prediction) website.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

The following machine learning algorithms were used in this project:

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine Classifier

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/employee-future-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd employee-future-prediction`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
5. Open the `employee-future-prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run the code.

## Usage

Once you have installed the required packages and started Jupyter Notebook, open the `employee-future-prediction.ipynb` file and run the code. The notebook contains step-by-step instructions on how to load and preprocess the data, train and evaluate the machine learning models, and make predictions.

## Results

The following are the results of the machine learning models:

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Decision Tree Classifier | 0.76 |
| Random Forest Classifier | 0.86 |
| Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier | 0.76 |
| Support Vector Machine Classifier | 0.81 |

The Random Forest Classifier performed the best with an accuracy of 0.86.

## Conclusion

This project shows how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict whether an employee is likely to leave a company or not. The Random Forest Classifier performed the best with an accuracy of 0.86. This model can be used by companies to identify employees who are at risk of leaving and take appropriate action to retain them.
