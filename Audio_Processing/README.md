# Audio Processing

This is a Python script for processing audio files using the pydub and scipy libraries. The script reads in an audio file, performs segmentation on the file, and filters out segments with low energy levels. This technique can be used to remove long pauses in audio speeches, improving the quality of the audio.

By adjusting the thres parameter, you can control the length of pauses that are removed from the audio. For example, setting thres to a low value will remove only very short pauses, while setting it to a high value will remove longer pauses.

Finally, the script concatenates the remaining segments and writes the resulting audio file.

## Requirements

* `pydub`
* `numpy`
* `scipy`

You can install these packages using `pip`. For example, `pip install pydub`.

## Usage

1. Place the audio file you want to process in the same directory as the script.

2. Update the filename in the script to match your file.

   ```python
   audiofile = AudioSegment.from_file("your_audio_file.mp3")
   ```

3. Run the ipynb file. The processed audio file will be saved in the same directory with the name `your_audio_file_processed.wav`.

4. For reference, i have added a sample audio file in the directory. 

## Parameters

There are a few parameters that you can adjust to fine-tune the processing:

* `segment_size_t`: The size of each segment in seconds.
* `thres`: The energy threshold used to filter out low-energy segments. You can adjust this value to control how many segments are kept.

## Conclusion

This script provides a basic framework for processing audio files using Python. You can use it as a starting point to build more advanced audio processing pipelines.
