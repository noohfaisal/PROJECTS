# AUDIO BOOK
## OVERVIEW
This is a Python script for converting a PDF file to an audiobook. The script reads in a PDF file, extracts the text from each page of the file, and uses the `gTTS` library to generate an audio file for each page. Finally, the script concatenates all the audio files into a single file to create an audiobook.

This script can be used to create audiobooks from any PDF file, making it a useful tool for people who want to listen to books or other documents on the go.

## Requirements

* `PyPDF2`
* `gTTS`

You can install these packages using `pip`. For example, `pip install PyPDF2`.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `pdf_to_audio.ipynb`.

2. Run the first code cell to import the required libraries.

3. Replace the filename in the second code cell with the name of your PDF file.

   ```python
   with open('your_pdf_file.pdf', 'rb') as pdf_file:
   ```

4. Run the second code cell to generate audio files for each page of the PDF file.

5. Run the third code cell to merge all the audio files into a single file.

6. The resulting audiobook will be saved in the same directory with the name `audiobook.mp3`.

## Parameters

There are no parameters that you need to adjust in the script. However, you can customize the output format of the audio files by changing the file extension in the `save()` method. For example, if you want to generate WAV files instead of MP3 files, you can change the method call to:

```python
tts.save('page_' + str(page+1) + '.wav')
```

## Limitations

The script may not work well for PDF files that contain images or other non-text elements. In these cases, the script may generate audio files with long pauses or incorrect pronunciations. Additionally, the quality of the audio files generated by `gTTS` may not be as high as professionally produced audiobooks.
